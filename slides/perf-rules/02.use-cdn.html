	<strong>A CDN is a "next-level" optimization.</strong>It is not a self-contained fix like a server configuration change or a small code modification.
	CDNs are paid, third-party services, and so implementation of one depends on your goals, priorities and budget.
	<br/>Will a CDN help improve the performance of your website? Yes.
	<br/><strong>Is it absolutely required for all websites? 
    No.</strong> You can still provide a decently fast website experience without a CDN - but it would probably be faster
	with one.
