    Hi, my name is Piotr Stapp. For many years I introduced myself as software developer.
    Then I started to call myself "problem solver" exactly as my initials
    <br/>
    But that's not true. I'm rather a problem creator :D
    <br/>-------------------------<br/>
    When I think about developers meeting, I don't know why in my mind I see A.A. meetings.
    A.A. meetings has a formal structure and formal introduction. So let me introduce myself:<br/> 
    "Hi! I'm Piotr and I'm a software developer for more than 10 years."
    But today I became some else I became a "Myth buster" and we, togherer, we talk about HTTP/2
