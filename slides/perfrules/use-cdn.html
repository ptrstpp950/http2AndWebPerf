    A CDN is a "next-level" optimization. It is not a self-contained fix like a server configuration change or a small code modification.
    CDNs are paid, third-party services, and so implementation of one depends on your goals, priorities and budget.
    <br/>Willa CDN help improve the performance of your website? Yes. 
    <br/>Is it absolutely required for all websites? 
    No. You can still provide a decently fast website experience without a CDN - but it would probably be faster with one.
